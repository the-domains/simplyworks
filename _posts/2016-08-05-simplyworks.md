  SimplyWorks.  Fuji Xerox has been in the business of solving our customers
  document management problems for half-a-century. As more organisations expand
  locally and globally, the need for each team member to tap into shared company
  information is pivotal to optimising and standardising operations. But with
  the increasing volume of data and countless documents processed daily, it has
  become more difficult for companies to manage their infrastructure.


  With Fuji Xerox’s solutions, businesses can manage documents from one
  place—editing, organising and digitising—and just as easily share these files
  with team members from all over the world. This not only guarantees the
  delivery of accurate and secure information, but also decreases the cost of
  data transfer and additional physical hardware such as IT servers—heightening
  overall efficiency, security, mobility and productivity.
