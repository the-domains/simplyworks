# SimplyWorks

Fuji Xerox has been in the business of solving our customers document management problems for half-a-century. As more organisations expand locally and globally, the need for each team member to tap into shared company information is pivotal to optimising and standardising operations. But with the increasing volume of data and countless documents processed daily, it has become more difficult for companies to manage their infrastructure.

With Fuji Xerox's solutions, businesses can manage documents from one place---editing, organising and digitising---and just as easily share these files with team members from all over the world. This not only guarantees the delivery of accurate and secure information, but also decreases the cost of data transfer and additional physical hardware such as IT servers---heightening overall efficiency, security, mobility and productivity.
